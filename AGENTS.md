# AGENTS.md

This repository is a Go CLI project for local AI agent interaction. Follow these guidelines for agentic coding:

## Build, Lint, and Test Commands
- Build: `make build` or `go build -o clai ./cmd/clai`
- Run: `make run` or `go run ./cmd/clai`
- Test all: `make test` or `go test ./...`
- Run a single test: `go test -run TestFunctionName ./...`
- Clean: `make clean`
- Install: `make install`
- Dev/debug: `make dev` (runs with DEBUG=true)

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use standard Go libraries; minimize dependencies.
- Group imports: stdlib first, then external.
- Format code with `gofmt`.
- Use clear, descriptive names for types, functions, and variables.
- Define tool schemas as Go structs for JSON marshalling.
- Handle errors gracefully (invalid JSON, tool failures, timeouts).
- Use Go doc comments for exported functions/types.
- Prefer explicit types and avoid unnecessary complexity.

## Testing
- Use Go's `testing` package for unit/integration tests.
- Mock external dependencies (e.g., Ollama) in tests.
- For Bubble Tea projects, follow the [Bubble Tea Agent Testing Strategy](BUBBLETEA_TESTING_STRATEGY.md) for all test creation. This document provides detailed guidelines and examples for unit, integration, and UI testing specific to Bubble Tea applications.
